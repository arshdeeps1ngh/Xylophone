# Xylophone App

Welcome to the Xylophone app, a simple iOS application developed as a part of Angela Yu's Udemy iOS 13 Development Course. This app is designed to simulate a xylophone, allowing users to play musical notes by tapping on colorful bars.

## App Description

The Xylophone app provides users with a virtual xylophone on their iOS devices. Each colorful bar on the screen represents a musical note. Users can tap on the bars to produce different sounds, creating their own melodies.

## Features

- Musical notes: The app features a set of colorful bars, each corresponding to a different musical note.
- Interactive: Users can tap on the bars to play musical notes and create tunes.

## Development Environment

To run the Xylophone app on your local machine, you will need:

- Xcode: Make sure you have Xcode installed, as it's the primary development environment for iOS apps.
- Swift: The app is developed using the Swift programming language, so familiarity with Swift basics is helpful.
- UIKit: The app uses UIKit for building the user interface.

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Xcode.
3. Build and run the app on the iOS Simulator or a physical device.
4. Tap the colorful bars to play musical notes and enjoy creating melodies.

## App Structure

The app's codebase is organized as follows:

- **Main.storyboard**: Contains the main user interface layout, including the colorful bars that represent musical notes.
- **ViewController.swift**: Handles the logic for playing audio when bars are tapped.
